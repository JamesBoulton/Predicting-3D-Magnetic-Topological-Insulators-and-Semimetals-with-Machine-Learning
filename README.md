1. In order to produce the directories "label1", "label0", "candidate", and "dwave_natoms_10_Neeltemp_293" the files "JB_download_label1.ipynb", "JB_download_label0.ipynb", "JB_download_candidate.ipynb", and "NEMAD_download_dwave_natoms_10_Neeltemp_293.ipynb" should be run respectively. This step is not required for reproducing the results of "Predicting 3D Magnetic Insulators and Semimetals with Machine Learning", as csv files produced from the downloaded cifs have been included within this github site. Note that results may change slightly if the cif files are downloaded fresh since Materials Project may have updated files in their database since the paper "Predicting 3D Magnetic Insulators and Semimetals with Machine Learning" was written.
2. Run the files "_.ipynb" and "_.ipynb" to reproduce the results of "Predicting 3D Magnetic Insulators and Semimetals with Machine Learning". These files will soon be uploaded to the github site.
